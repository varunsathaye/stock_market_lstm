# 📈 Stock Market Analysis & Prediction Using LSTM

A deep learning project that analyzes historical stock market data of major tech companies and predicts future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

## 🧠 Overview

This project leverages historical stock price data and time series modeling techniques to forecast the future closing price of Apple Inc. (AAPL). It incorporates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), correlation studies, feature engineering, and deep learning using LSTM to capture temporal patterns in financial data.
