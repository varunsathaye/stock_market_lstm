# Stock Market Analysis & Prediction Using LSTM

A deep learning project that analyzes historical stock market data of major tech companies and predicts future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

## Overview

This project leverages historical stock price data and time series modeling techniques to forecast the future closing price of Apple Inc. (AAPL). It incorporates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), correlation studies, feature engineering, and deep learning using LSTM to capture temporal patterns in financial data.

## Features

-  Downloaded and processed 13+ years of stock data using `yfinance` and `pandas_datareader`
-  Visualized price trends, trading volume, moving averages (10, 20, 50 days)
-  Computed daily returns and created heatmaps & risk-return plots for comparative analysis
-  Applied Min-Max normalization on over 3,000 data points for model stability
-  Built and trained an LSTM model using `Keras` and `TensorFlow`
-  Achieved >95% training accuracy on closing price prediction for AAPL
-  Plotted predicted vs actual price curves for performance validation
